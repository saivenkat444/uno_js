- create the file structures
    -->one source file
    -->one readme file
    -->if possible one for the test cases
    -->one main file
- write the logic for the uno game
- think of the test cases and note them down



code logics
- 
- take the number of players with their names
- shuffle the cards
- distribute the cards
- make a deck
- take each players cards and play the game 
- when deck empties, the cards that were played should be shuffled
- when reversed there should be a mechanism where the player order should be reversed


player logic 
- 
- i think that the players names should be an array. so whenever the reverse card is used it should change the order of the players
- when one player has ended the game his name can be removed from the players list and then it can be moved to the winners array.
- when only one person is left. we will take his name into the winners array and then we can display the leader board according to the winners list.
- here array should be used becuase the order of the winners matters



cards
- 
- there are four coloue cards(red, green, blue, yellow)
- each colour contains one 0 card and two other cards including numbers and +2, skip, reverse
- there are four colour change cards and four +4 cards
